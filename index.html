    <h2>Ethan Glenn</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone! I am 20 years old and am from Canada.</p>
    <p>I served in the Utah St. George Mission and loved it! Although it got a little hot there, for a Canadian.</p>
    <p>I am a Computer Science Major in my second semester. I have worked with HTML before and have made my <br>own websites.
        I am excited to learn more about all that in this class.
    </p>
    <p>I also love playing pickleball!</p>
