      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      My personal website will be a place where anyone can explore a comprehensive overview of my skills, experience,
      and services as a computer scientist. Designed as a hub for potential employers, clients, and collaborators, this
      platform aims to establish a strong online presence and differentiate myself from others in today’s highly
      competitive field. By providing a seamless user experience and valuable content, visitors will find a compelling
      reason to choose me over others.</p>
    <p><b>Content</b><br>
      Upon visiting my site, visitors can view and see technical skills, education and experience. This information
      allows employers and potential clients to assess whether my skill set aligns with their specific requirements.
      There will also be a portfolio section that showcases a diverse range of projects that I have worked in, providing
      visual representations of my capabilities. I will present my professional background, educational qualifications,
      work history, and notable achievements. By doing this it will help convey my experience and serve to help
      employers and others know that I will be able to work well on their teams. I am hoping that by doing this,
      employers and clients will value me higher as I showcase my qualifications.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p><b>Portfolio</b><br>
      Visitors can expect a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate portfolio section that showcases a variety of
      projects. Each project is accompanied by a description, key features, and technologies used. To build credibility,
      testimonials and reviews from past clients and employers are included. The site will also outline some freelance
      development services that I offer and provide a way to get in contact with me for business inquiries. The
      important aspect of this will be that everything is clear and easy to follow. Simplicity is key because if someone
      is interested it is very easy for them to lose interest if something isn’t easy to follow. There will also be
      links to my GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles.

        In order for interested parties to be able to contact me very easily there will be a simple contact form page that
        will take in a user's name, email, and the reason for contact. This will keep the line of communication simple and
        open. That is all that will be on this page in order to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
      <p><b>What sets me apart</b><br>
        What sets my website apart is the combination of clear and concise information, visual appeal, professionalism,
        and a personal touch. The content is presented in a well-organized manner, making it easy for visitors to find the
        details they seek, regardless of their technical background. The visually appealing design, enhanced by
        high-quality images (very important), engaging graphics and animations, and a clean layout, creates a memorable
        experience. In conclusion, my personal website serves as a digital portfolio, allowing employers, clients, and
        collaborators
        to discover my skills, experience, and freelance development services. With its user-friendly design,
        comprehensive content, and emphasis on building trust, my website provides a compelling reason for visitors to
        choose my platform over others.
